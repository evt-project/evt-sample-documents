There are 3 ready-to-use examples. The one used by default is n. 1.

If you want to explore the other two you will just have to open the corresponding file_config_**.json file (f.i. file_config_DOTR.json), copy its content and paste it into the main file_config.json file overwriting the existing configuration. Then go to the index.html opened in your browser and reload the page!

EXAMPLE 1: pelavicino.xml - Short extract of the Codice Pelavicino edition, which presents the encoding of named entities, in particular person, place and organization names. Configurations for this edition: file_config_Pelavicino.json, edition_config_Pelavicino.json and ui_config_Pelavicino.json.

EXAMPLE 2: pseudoEdition.xml - Pseudo edition for demonstration and testing purposes only, originally encoded by Marjorie Burghart for her TEI Critical Toolbox software, and modified in order to cover the highest number of possible use cases. It presents just the critical apparatus entry, displayed inline, within the main text. Configurations for this edition: file_config_PseudoEdition.json, edition_config_PseudoEdition.json and ui_config_PseudoEdition.json

EXAMPLE 3: VB-23-DOTR.xml.xml - Short extract of Dream Of The Rood from The Vercelli Book. Configurations for this edition: file_config_DOTR.json, edition_config_DOTR.json and ui_config_DOTR.json

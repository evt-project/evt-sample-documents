              <p>The Ruthwell Cross is a 17 foot high stone cross in Ruthwell (Dumfriesshire, Scotland).</p>
            </physDesc>
            <history>
              <origin>The Ruthwell Cross was erected in the <origDate>eighth century</origDate> at a former military
                site (later probably a monastery) in Ruthwell (Dumfriesshire, Scotland) when the village was part of the
                Anglo-Saxon <origPlace>Kingdom of Northumbria</origPlace>. It was pulled down and broken in the
                seventeenth century and partially reconstructed in the nineteenth. It is now located in a small apse on
                the north side of the Ruthwell parish church. The cross is perhaps best known for a runic inscription
                that may represent the oldest known record of an Anglo-Saxon vernacular poem, versions of which can be
                found in the tenth-century Vercelli Book and eleventh-century Brussels Cross (see Ó Carragáin 2005,
                58-60; O'Donnell 1996, 287-288).</origin>

              </objectIdentifier>
              <physDesc>
                <p>The Evangelist and his symbol, the eagle, face each other. Their pose, as well as the large size of
                  the eagle in comparison to the evangelist, is intended to convey the divine inspiration passed to the
                  human evangelist through his symbol. John appears to be seated. He reaches out towards his symbol with
                  his left hand, which possibly supports a scroll or book. Traces of an inscription survive. The letters
                  INP run upwards within the left border of the panel, while the letters BVM run downwards in the lower
                  corner of the right border. They can most likely be reconstructed as the beginning and end of the
                  Latin phrase ‘In principio erat verbum’ (In the beginning was the word), the opening line of John’s
                  gospel.</p>
                <p>This panel originally faced the other way, capping the west face of the Cross. It was placed back to
                  front when the cross was reconstructed by the Rev Henry Duncan in 1823.</p>

                <p>The transom has never been found. The current stone is the work of the mason commissioned by Duncan
                  to reconstruct the cross in 1823. The carvings are masonic symbols and were supplied by Duncan, a keen
                  freemason: a triangle at the centre, flanked by a whale or dolphin to the left and a dragon to the
                  right.</p>

              <physDesc>
                <p>The lower arm of the cross-head contains an archer drawing back his bow, possibly firing an arrow at
                  the eagle originally positioned at the top of this face of the cross (see west face). A square pouch
                  hangs from a strap below his right arm. It may be meant to represent a quiver, though it has also been
                  suggested that it is a book satchel and that the archer should be understood as firing arrows of
                  scripture. The archer’s cloak flies out behind him emphasizing his dynamic pose and the force of his
                  movement. The panel may relate to the words of the poem inscribed on the left border of the south
                  face, where the cross describes itself as ‘wounded with arrows’.</p>

              </objectIdentifier>
              <physDesc>
                <p>There is some debate over the subject of this panel. Some scholars believe that it depicts the
                  Visitation (Luke 1:30–56), the moment at which Elizabeth (pregnant with John the Baptist) and Mary
                  (pregnant with the Christ child) embrace, and the Baptist leaps for joy in recognition of Christ’s
                  divinity. Other scholars believe it represents the biblical sisters Martha and Mary (Luke 10:38–42),
                  symbols of the active and contemplative sides of monastic life. Still others believe that it is a
                  deliberate conflation of the two subjects. The concrete blocks and lower fragments of the panel were
                  added by Duncan during his restoration of the cross. The difference in scale between the hemlines and
                  feet in the lower section and the proportions and drapery of the torsos in the upper section may
                  indicate that the block with the feet does not belong here and is, perhaps, part of a now lost
                  monument. Unlike the other figures on this side of the cross, the women wear sturdy shoes or
                  slippers.</p>
                <p>The inscription is unique on the monument for its combination of Latin and runic letters. It reads
                  […] marþ[a] (left border); mar[ia] m[…]r + (top border); dominnæ c[…] (right border). The words have
                  been translated as either ‘Martha and Mary worthy women’, or, more problematically, ‘Martha and Mary,
                  mother of the Lord’.</p>

              </objectIdentifier>
              <physDesc>
                <p>This panel depicts Mary Magdalene washing Christ’s feet with her tears and drying them with her hair
                  (Luke 7:37–8). The Magdalene’s massive hand and extended arm may have been meant to emphasize her
                  gesture, and hence her penitence, or they may simply be the work of a second-rate carver. Christ
                  stands above the Magdalene holding up a book in his covered left hand. His right hand was originally
                  raised in blessing. His pose echoes that seen in the Christ over the beasts panel on the opposite face
                  of the cross. The facial features of both figures have been hacked or worn away.</p>
                <p>The Latin inscription surrounding the panel reads: + A[TT]V[LIT] [ALA]B[A]S (across the top); TRVM ·
                  V[NGUE]NTI · &amp; S[T]AN[S] [R]E[TR]O SECVS PEDES (down the right side); · EIUS LACRIMIS · COEPIT
                  RIGARE · PEDES EIUS &amp; CAPILLIS (down the left side) · CAPITIS SUI TERGEBAT (across the bottom).
                  Translation: ‘+ She took an alabaster jar of ointment, and standing behind at his feet, she began to
                  wash his feet with her tears and dried them with the hair of her head’.</p>

                <p>Christ, on the left, extends his hand towards the man blind from birth (John 9:1–8) on the right. A
                  thin diagonal line incised in the background of the panel indicates that Christ’s right hand may
                  originally have held a wand with which to anoint the blind man’s eyes. While the blind man has been
                  carved in profile, Christ’s body and face are turned slightly outwards, allowing us a better view of
                  the miracle. The lower part of the panel may have been left blank by the sculptor for reasons unknown,
                  or may have contained an inscription that was destroyed at a later date. The extension of the robes of
                  the two figures over the border of the blank section of the panel is part of Duncan’s restoration.</p>
                <p>The Latin inscription in the border reads: + ET PRAETERIENS · VIDI[T] (down the left side) {HOMINEM
                  CAECVM} A NATIBITATE · ET S{ANAVIT EVM} (down the right side). Translation: ‘+ And passing by he saw a
                  {man blind} from birth and {healed him}’.</p>

                <p>The archangel Gabriel seems to be entering at the left of the panel from a space outside the cross.
                  The lower part of his robe flutters behind him, and both it and his right foot appear to overlap the
                  panel’s left border. On the right, the Virgin Mary, facing out at us, holds on to her robe with her
                  right hand as she shrinks slightly away from the angel in humility. Both figures are tall, elegant and
                  finely carved, making this one of the most classicizing of the cross’s panels. The hole in the centre
                  of the panel may be a relic cavity (perhaps for a relic of the True Cross), or it may have been made
                  at some point during the toppling of the cross, or during its restoration and reconstruction.</p>
                <p>All that remains of the inscription in the border are the letters ‘+ INGRESSVS ANG’ (across the top
                  border), and ‘TE […] BE (down the left border). It has been reconstructed as ‘Ingressus angelus ad eam
                  dixit ave gratia plena dominus tecum benedicta tu in mulieribus’ (Entering the angel said to her:
                  “Hail full of grace, the Lord is with you; blessed are you among women”.)</p>

                <p>Crucifixion: The base of the cross may originally have been sunk in the ground and this carving added
                  to it when the cross was raised and moved to a new location. It is carved in a 9th-century style, so
                  is clearly later than the rest of the carvings on the cross. At the centre is the crucified Christ,
                  his head drooping to the right. Discs representing the sun and the moon are carved either side of the
                  top of his cross. The figures standing below the cross to either side of Christ may be the Virgin Mary
                  and John the Evangelist, who witnessed the Crucifixion, or they may be Longinus and Stephaton, the
                  spear- and sponge-bearer.</p>

                     <p>The Ruthwell Cross is a 17 foot high stone cross erected near a former Roman military site in
                        Dumfriesshire Scotland. It is perhaps best known to Anglo-Saxonists for a runic inscription that
                        may be the oldest known record of an Anglo-Saxon vernacular poem, versions of which can be found
                        in the tenth-century Vercelli Book and eleventh-century Brussels Cross (see Ó Carragáin 2005,
                        58-60; O'Donnell 1996, 287-288, for bibliography).</p>

                        <p>The Evangelist and his symbol, the eagle, face each other. Their pose, as well as the large
                           size of the eagle in comparison to the evangelist, is intended to convey the divine
                           inspiration passed to the human evangelist through his symbol. John appears to be seated. He
                           reaches out towards his symbol with his left hand, which possibly supports a scroll or book.
                           Traces of an inscription survive. The letters INP run upwards within the left border of the
                           panel, while the letters BVM run downwards in the lower corner of the right border. They can
                           most likely be reconstructed as the beginning and end of the Latin phrase ‘In principio erat
                           verbum’ (In the beginning was the word), the opening line of John’s gospel.</p>
                        <p>This panel originally faced the other way, capping the west face of the Cross. It was placed
                           back to front when the cross was reconstructed by the Rev Henry Duncan in 1823.</p>

                           by Duncan, a keen freemason: a triangle at the centre, flanked by a whale or dolphin to the
                           left and a dragon to the right.</p>

                        <p>The lower arm of the cross-head contains an archer drawing back his bow, possibly firing an
                           arrow at the eagle originally positioned at the top of this face of the cross (see west
                           face). A square pouch hangs from a strap below his right arm. It may be meant to represent a
                           quiver, though it has also been suggested that it is a book satchel and that the archer
                           should be understood as firing arrows of scripture. The archer’s cloak flies out behind him
                           emphasizing his dynamic pose and the force of his movement. The panel may relate to the words
                           of the poem inscribed on the left border of the south face, where the cross describes itself
                           as ‘wounded with arrows’.</p>

                     <physDesc>
                        <p>There is some debate over the subject of this panel. Some scholars believe that it depicts
                           the Visitation (Luke 1:30–56), the moment at which Elizabeth (pregnant with John the Baptist)
                           and Mary (pregnant with the Christ child) embrace, and the Baptist leaps for joy in
                           recognition of Christ’s divinity. Other scholars believe it represents the biblical sisters
                           Martha and Mary (Luke 10:38–42), symbols of the active and contemplative sides of monastic
                           life. Still others believe that it is a deliberate conflation of the two subjects. The
                           concrete blocks and lower fragments of the panel were added by Duncan during his restoration
                           of the cross. The difference in scale between the hemlines and feet in the lower section and
                           the proportions and drapery of the torsos in the upper section may indicate that the block
                           with the feet does not belong here and is, perhaps, part of a now lost monument. Unlike the
                           other figures on this side of the cross, the women wear sturdy shoes or slippers.</p>
                        <p>The inscription is unique on the monument for its combination of Latin and runic letters. It
                           reads […] marþ[a] (left border); mar[ia] m[…]r + (top border); dominnæ c[…] (right border).
                           The words have been translated as either ‘Martha and Mary worthy women’, or, more
                           problematically, ‘Martha and Mary, mother of the Lord’.</p>

                        <p>This panel depicts Mary Magdalene washing Christ’s feet with her tears and drying them with
                           her hair (Luke 7:37–8). The Magdalene’s massive hand and extended arm may have been meant to
                           emphasize her gesture, and hence her penitence, or they may simply be the work of a
                           second-rate carver. Christ stands above the Magdalene holding up a book in his covered left
                           hand. His right hand was originally raised in blessing. His pose echoes that seen in the
                           Christ over the beasts panel on the opposite face of the cross. The facial features of both
                           figures have been hacked or worn away.</p>

                        <p>Christ, on the left, extends his hand towards the man blind from birth (John 9:1–8) on the
                           right. A thin diagonal line incised in the background of the panel indicates that Christ’s
                           right hand may originally have held a wand with which to anoint the blind man’s eyes. While
                           the blind man has been carved in profile, Christ’s body and face are turned slightly
                           outwards, allowing us a better view of the miracle. The lower part of the panel may have been
                           left blank by the sculptor for reasons unknown, or may have contained an inscription that was
                           destroyed at a later date. The extension of the robes of the two figures over the border of

                           to overlap the panel’s left border. On the right, the Virgin Mary, facing out at us, holds on
                           to her robe with her right hand as she shrinks slightly away from the angel in humility. Both
                           figures are tall, elegant and finely carved, making this one of the most classicizing of the
                           cross’s panels. The hole in the centre of the panel may be a relic cavity (perhaps for a
                           relic of the True Cross), or it may have been made at some point during the toppling of the

                           9th-century style, so is clearly later than the rest of the carvings on the cross. At the
                           centre is the crucified Christ, his head drooping to the right. Discs representing the sun
                           and the moon are carved either side of the top of his cross. The figures standing below the
                           cross to either side of Christ may be the Virgin Mary and John the Evangelist, who witnessed
                           the Crucifixion, or they may be Longinus and Stephaton, the spear- and sponge-bearer.</p>
